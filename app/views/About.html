    <h2>About</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Galactic is a map of the Internet - a crowdsourced collection of connections between URLs that exists to better answer the question <i>"what is like this?"</i>, online. The way it works is that contributors make connections between URL pairs which others can discover later. These URL pairs are called <i>edges</i>, and act as a pathway between similar ideas.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to create a new way for people to discover information online, while at the same time creating an outlet for the synaptic burst that happens when the human brain does what it does best: make connections between things!</p>
    <p>As the number of edges grows so does the usefulness of Galactic, so we hope you will join us in making the Internet better, together.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Sincerly yours,<br />
    Eoin &#38; Jeff</p>
