    <p>The WikiWeb is a network of crowdsourced connections between content. We like to think of it as a map of the Internet, but most people prefer to think of the WikiWeb as a place to find suggestions for <em>what to read next on the Internet</em>.</p>

    <br />
    <p>Accessing the WikiWeb requires <a href="/download">downloading the Chrome plugin</a>. Once that's done, you're good to go: you'll see the WikiWeb navbar at the bottom of your browser with interesting links to explore. Occasionally, you might even want to add your own.</p>

    <br />
    <p>The more people who contribute to the WikiWeb the better it gets. If you have any quesitons or suggestions please send them to <a href="mailto:hello@wikiweb.org?Subject=Hey WikiWeb!" target="_top">hello@wikiweb.org</a>. Let's make the Internet better, together!</p>

    <br />
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Eoin & Jeff</p>
